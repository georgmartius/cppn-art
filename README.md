# cppn-art
Creating abstract art images with CPPNs

you need

- python3

packages:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pillow
- jupyter

install for instance with

`python3 -m pip install --user numpy matplotlib pillow jupyter`

I also recommend to install the extensions:
[jupyter contrib nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions). See instructions on that page
